			                    <h2>GAStech issues</h2>
			                    <p>
			                        The GAStech company has moved to a new building, but there are still some HVAC issues that need to be resolved.
			                        The building might show high concentrations of Hazium, which is a dangerous particle.
			                        GAStech has chosen to install Hazium sensors in the building, but these sensors are new and thus expensive.
			                        To keep track where employees are in the building, they have to wear a prox card at all times.
			                        A prox sensor scans every 5 minutes to check who is in which room.
			                        The problem is that not every employee is evenly diligent with their prox card and might not take it with them when they leave the room.
			                        If employees lose their prox card, they can pick them up again at the security desk.
			                        Additonally, the company has a mobile prox sensor in the form of Rosie the robot.
			                        She can scan for prox cards while she is on the go.
			                    </p>
			                    <br/>
			                    <h2>Goal</h2>
			                    <p>
			                        The goal of this project is to visualize the provided data to inspect the patterns of the GAStech company:
			                        what are the patterns of the employees? What does a typical day at GAStech look like?
			                        Are there anomalies or unusual events in the data?
			                        The end goal is to explain the significance of the patterns, see if the issues represent dangerous activities or issues for building operations and
			                        describe the relationship between proximity card data en building data elements.
			                    </p>
			                    <br/>
			                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
			                    <p>
			                        The visualisations are split into multiple views.
			                        They can be found on the visualisations page.
			                        On the visualisations page there are multiple buttons to control which data is shown. You can pick from General, which is data from the entire building, and floors 1/2/3.
			                        The general data is split per floor while the floor data is split by zone, either HVAC or prox zone, depending on the data.
			                        Finally there is a Findings page, which discusses the results from the visualisations, including patterns, anomalies and relationships.
			                    </p>
			                    <br/>
			                    <h2>Tools</h2>
			                    <p>
			                        The data used in this project and the visualization was provided by the <a href="http://vacommunity.org/2016+VAST+Challenge%3A+MC2" target="_blank">VACommunity</a>.
			                        The data was made up and only provided for use with Mini Challenge 2. The visualisations were made using the <a href="https://d3js.org " target="_blank">D3</a> library.
			                        D3 was used for loading the data and visualizing it. Other libraries used include <a href="https://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-queue" target="_blank">D3 Queue</a>.
			                    </p>

			                    <h2>Credits</h2>
			                    <p>
			                        Made by Team Gosia Warriors for the Programming project in 2016. Special thanks to Gosia for the idea and the support throughout the project and to Sascha for the supervision.
