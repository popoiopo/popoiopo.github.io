[{"categories":["ComputerScience"],"content":" Why am I writing this?  As I am reading this book I want to create a place where I can place my notes in a way that makes sense and that is easily used for reference later on. After several years of doing projects and using the superficial git commands it is time to delve a little deeper and actually understand what I'm doing. Instead of merely repeating git commands I find on stack overflow whenever there is something that needs to be fixed. As I do see the value of using branches, merging files etc, they have always scared me somehow. So let's try to overcome this by reading the book and making a nice post in the meantime!\n  What is version Control?  Controling them versions  We've all been there in the good old days. Writing a report in word, saving it with a name like final report.docx. But after some feedback from the teacher, you need to make some changes. However, just working in your old file just makes you feel antsy, you've worked really hard on those things you wrote! So you make the suggested changes and call the new file final final report.docx. But, then you ask a friend to look at your work and give some feedback which then culminates in a third final report3.docx. This is the moment that you look at your folder and realize the hell that you're creating for yourself! And that, my friends, is where version control comes in.\n    Version control is a way to keep track of your changes in a project (usually a folder that has all the important files relating to a project). These changes can entail anything in any file within that project, from changing images if you are a graphic designer to changes in code files if you are building an application. The reason you'd want this, is because it gives you the ability to revert to earlier states in your project (you know, before you made that horrible mistake that messed everything up).\n So the way version control handles keeping track of these ghosts of the past, is by utilizing a database that keeps track of all changes. So each file is essentially linked to its former versions in said database. More specifically, it keeps track of the differences between files (so not neccessarily each whole file). So re-creating a file becomes just a function of adding up all changes up to the version you're interested in.\n  Collaboration  Collaborating in a project with multiple people brings about it's own special set of problems. First of all, the projects needs to be accessible to all collaborators. This can be done by one centralized server to which people can log in, have all versioned files in one place, and make changes. However, having a single place to which you store your files is never a good idea. What is the server, which is just some computer elsewhere that you can log in to, crashes? What if there is a power outage in the server location? You'd be unable to work for that time.\n That is why distributed version control systems such as Git exist. Things are not being kept on a single location, but rather on all locations that work in the project. With this I mean that every collaborator keeps its own mirror of the project, including its full history of all files. So when a new person wants to join the collaboration, they just have to pull the latest version from the server and off they go! Therefore, if any of the machines blow up (to be a bit dramatic) the other computers will still have their version of the entire project.\n    Figure of a distributed version control system (figure is from cite:chacon2014pro)    If one person makes changes to their own version of the project, they can push that version to the server, making it accessible to all collaborators. Those other people can then pull the newest version, and work with that while still keeping track of who made what changes at which spot.\n The way this all works exactly is a ofcourse a bit more intricate than I described here, but we got the basic intuition here. There are more problems that need to be adressed, and we'll get to those in another post. But the foundation of understanding version control has been laid here.\n    ","description":"","tags":["Git","VersionControl"],"title":"Lets talk about git","uri":"/post/lets_talk_about_git/"},{"categories":["Writing"],"content":" Once upon a time, there was a land filled with retirees in a kingdom far, far away. These elderly people might have been old, but were still very much young at heart. However, the land was much too big, and all lived at a great distance from one another, making contact difficult. These were trying times, as a new disease called \"loneliness\" ravaged the lands.\n One day, the king decided to summon his counsel and ordered them to develop new and innovative ways to combat this \"loneliness.\" But all the kings' horses, and all the kings' men, could not make the land great again. The \"loneliness\" kept on with it's devouring appetite, and people even spoke of a situation of pandemic proportions. And so it was, for months, the kingdom was as if it was shut down. It's citizens experiencing loneliness so profound; they did not want to come out of bed anymore.\n At one Thursday morning, somewhere in July, a peculiar little creature popped up. It had pointy ears, big eyes, and wearing nothing but a raggedy cushion cover and one single sock. Looking dazed, it slowly stumbled towards a big fallen oak tree. As it sat there, for three hours long, it pondered where it was, and how it got there. Especially the \"where\" of it all was quite the conundrum. It had already become midday by this time, and the creature set out to find someone to talk to.\n Two days went by, and the little creature did not find anyone until it stumbled onto what seemed to be an abandoned house. At least, so it seemed. The creature knocked on the door, and no one answered. It walked around to the garden, and no one was there. It even climbed up on the roof to look through the windows, but they were so dirty that it could not even see through them. The little creature was just about to give up when he saw a tiny window open on the side of the house. Being of a very small stature himself, he had no difficulty in climbing through. Though it was nervous, it had to find at least a place to sleep. First, there was a large and dusty living room. Then, a cold hallway tiled with marble stones leading to a wooden carved stairway. Up the stairs, the creature went, when a glimpse of movement caught his eye.\n A PERSON!\n Quickly and overeagerly, he ran towards the room. There was a queen-sized bed with an older gentleman in it. The gentleman was startled and hid under the covers, hoping that the creature would go away. But the creature did not go away; it even spoke to him. It noticed how frightened the man was and immediately calmed down. \"Hello, I'm awfully sorry to barge in like this,\" the creature said. \"May I ask you what your name is? Mine is Dobby.\". The gentleman was so captured by Dobby's politeness and warm voice that he could not help but feeling calmed down. \"Robert… My name is Robert.\", he said. Robert, who had not seen anyone in what seems to be forever, was filled with glee and confusion. Another person!\n As Dobby and Robert were glad to have finally found someone, they began to talk. After conversing for hours on end until it became dark outside, Dobby queried an especially important question. \"Where is everyone?\" asked Dobby. Robert reacted with silence. A silence broken by a tear that rolled down from his cheek, after which he replied: \"The loneliness… The loneliness has gotten a hold of all of us. Even the king attempted to make things right, but no one succeeded…\". Dobby sat there and thought about what exactly loneliness was. Loneliness is a distressing experience when a person's social relationships are perceived to be less in quantity, especially in quality, than desired. While Dobby sat there, thinking, Robert went to bed as it was already far beyond midnight. Dobby, however, stayed and pondered. Social relationships that are perceived less in quantity and especially in quality… What can help? What can bring people together? What can bridge these vast distances and combat this \"loneliness\"? Dobby sat quietly, thinking until he fell asleep.\n A rumbling sound. There was a rumbling sound coming from downstairs, and a fantastic smell welcomed Dobby back to reality. He went downstairs only to find Robert up and about, happily making breakfast for the both of them. Robert greeted Dobby with a grand smile, and then a moment! A special eureka moment! Dobby had found what he spent all night looking for and was overjoyed. \"Personal contact!\" screamed Dobby. \"Personal, meaningful contact with other people!\". Robert looked confused and asked what Dobby was trying to tell him. Back where Dobby was from, there was this magical thing called the internet. And the internet could connect people with strange contraptions called \"phones\". A rather silly name, but they held great powers of communication. In these \"phones,\" people could play games, talk to one another, and send snapshots of pretty much anything! \"With these phones, we could connect these people living in isolation! They could talk to each other all the time, just like we did last night,\" said Dobby. Robert was so excited about this story that he forgot that he was cooking and accidentally burned his specialty dish, eggs benedict. He told about a treasure chest that the king had for innovative projects, which he called the National Wellbeing Operation (NWO). The NWO was explicitly set up to fund new projects that showed great promise to increase the kingdoms' wellbeing. Dobby felt they were onto something significant, and Robert suggested going to the king as soon as possible. They got ready, ate the burned eggs benedict that has never tasted better, and left.\n A long and arduous journey ensued. A journey containing enough material to cover several books had come to an end. The two travelers had reached the castle of the king.\n An open gate, an empty hall, a dusty dining room were all that reminded Dobby about his first encounter with Robert. On arriving at the kingly bedroom, there was a man. Big in stature, but small in demeanor. A man who has long forgotten his ruling position as he roamed the castle day in, day out until he had become bedridden. Upon seeing the two travelers, a sea of emotions swept over him. Surprised, frightened, and happy were only some of his feelings when Dobby first spoke to him. To calm the king, Robert took everyone to the royal kitchen and made his improved signature dish, burned eggs benedict.\n After being calmed down, Dobby went on to explain his ideas. The internet, the phones, and the NWO funding that would be needed to create an application that could connect all the kingdom's senior citizens. Having heard everything, the king sat quietly. Was this the answer to his problems? Could this project be the remedy to loneliness? He stood up and walked out onto the courtyard. With each step, it seemed that his back straightened up more and more until his small demeanor changed into an impressive display of authority. He laughed loudly and yelled: \"Of course you can have funding, I am completely at your service!\". The king foresaw one issue, though. The internet of which Dobby spoke was no easy thing to obtain. It was guarded in the black forest by a mighty fairy queen named Fay. If the plan were to succeed, they would need to convince Fay to share her precious internet with the world.\n Filled with renewed energy, the three companions left to the black forest. After a journey with many perils and adventures that would be told for generations to come, they finally arrived. There was a beautiful treehouse that grew in a way that the three travelers had never seen before. Long spirals of black wood reached as far as the eyes can see, and a single staircase that went up far beyond the forest canopy from back home. They went up and walked on the tune of what seemed like a thousand birds singing in perfect unison. Arriving at the top, there was a pond with frogs the size of horses and someone sitting at the end, wearing the most beautiful crown made out of golden leaves and silver flowers. It was queen Fay, already waiting for their arrival as the woods themselves had already informed her there were strangers in her forest. She stood up, spread her wings, and as if instantaneous, she flew towards the traveling fellowship. Hovering quietly in the air, she inquired about their purpose. She demanded them to explain quickly and concisely as she was not known for her patience. The king stepped forward and kneeled before queen Faye. \"My kingdom has befallen great tragedy, my queen. An illness named 'loneliness' has ravaged over my lands. It is our belief that the internet you hold power over could be the answer to our suffering. Our brave friend and scholar called Dobby has proved himself able to research and possibly rid my kingdom of loneliness with something called an app, which requires access to your internet\".\n The queen's face was stern, as she did not understand this concept of loneliness. She looked at Dobby and asked him to explain. \"It is our belief that loneliness is an unpleasant emotional response to perceived isolation. A type of social pain that can lie at the root of many issues, both psychological and physical. Our quest entails removing this ailment from the people by creating a communication platform that is a playful virtual environment to share one's experiences and make new ones. This application will monitor and optimize social interaction as it develops and deepens its users' relationships.\" The queen found difficulty in this concept, as she was never alone. She interacted with the birds, the frogs, and even the forest itself. As such, she had never known such a painful silence in her life. However, she could understand when thinking about losing her forest. This was a chilling thought which caused her to agree and provide access to the internet.\n The fellowship was happy that they could finally start their research, but all knew that they still had a long way to go. A total of four years passed in which several ups and downs were posed. An arduous road that eventually led to the application Dobby has dreamed about. As they released it, it spread like wildfire. Every single person in the kingdom started playing, talking, laughing with one another. The loneliness had finally subsided. Dobby was awarded the medal of doctorship and a fresh set of clean clothes. However, there was one piece of clothing that Dobby did not want to part from. The one single sock that held special meaning to him.\n And they lived happily ever after.\n","description":"","tags":["Storytelling"],"title":"The creature, the gentleman, and the king","uri":"/post/dobby-fairytale/"},{"categories":["Writing"],"content":" Once upon a time, there was a french frog named Frederique. Frederique's fragrance was, frankly, somewhat frustrating to him. This, and his freckled appearance, freaked out many a Frenchman; Frederique was frequently lonely.\n Fretting about the lack of frivolousness in his life, he sat on a frosty, frizzy piece of fruit, frowning. Will he ever find friends? He knows no other frogs from around… And there he saw it… Right in front of a fruitcake, someone frivolously threw away. It was a flower that, frankly, threw him off guard. He hopped over and asked for her name.\n Daisy, the dancing dandelion! That is my name, answered Daisy. Frederique found himself dazed and feeling the dandiest feeling. Daisy's fragrance fragmented his own, relieving him from his frustrations regarding his freshness. \"Will you be my friend?\" asked Frederique.\n Daisy, who was a bit damaged by the fruitcake dangled daintily, and daringly replied: Are you daft?!

Hij was aan het luisteren, niet naar een iets in het bijzonder. Maar gewoon… Luisteren. Toen de Eekhoorn langs liep was hij verwonderd over waarom de olifant zo stilletjes erbij zat. Hij kwam wat dichter bij en wachtte even. Er gebeurde helemaal niks. Nog iets dichter bij dan maar. Hmm, nog steeds niks, en de olifant zat daar maar. De eekhoorn besloot het maar gewoon te vragen. \"Olifant? Mag ik vragen wat je aan het doen bent?\", vroeg de eekhoorn. \"Luisteren.\", fluisterde olifant met groot gespreide oren. Ik ben aan het luisteren. Er is wind, er zijn vogels, ik hoor water stromen, en ik hoor zelfs een paar vlinders vechten even verder op. Maar er is nog iets…\n De eekhoorn ging ook maar zitten luisteren. Misschien kon hij wel helpen, je weet het nooit. Misschien hoorde hij toevallig iets wat de olifant niet hoorde, hoewel zijn oren wel veel kleiner zijn dan de indrukwekkend grote oren van de olifant. Een bij kwam langs, een ekster zag een glimmend steentje en kwam die ophalen, een worm stak zijn hoofd boven de grond, schrok bij het zijn van de olifant en ging snel weer de grond in. Maar de olifant bleef nog steeds luisteren.\n Uiteindelijk werd het donker. Uiteindelijk werd het licht. De eekhoorn en de olifant zaten nog steeds te luisteren, totdat de eekhoorn het zat was en geïrriteerd aan de olifant vroeg: \"Waar wacht je nou eigenlijk op? Wat zoeken we?!\". \"Dat weet ik niet\", zei de olifant, waarop de eekhoorn in een boze bui weg stampte en nog nariep: \"Ach klim toch in een boom!\".

This website is where I share my thoughts and things that excite me.\nCurrently  Currently I am doing a PhD at the Radboud university of Nijmegen to apply the notions of Complexity Science to optimize gamified treatment of loneliness in the elderly. My bachelor was in Psychobiology and I minored in Programming at the University of Amsterdam. Quite a big change to go from studying the brain (from a molecular to psychological level) to begin learning how to program stuff.

I believe that pursuing knowledge, while very valuable in itself, is not enough to achieve true satisfaction. Sharing insights by, for example, actively teaching or, as here, writing a blog can both greatly increase your own understanding as well as helping someone who is on a similar path as yourself.

As a PhD candidate my occupation involves science, and in particular regarding subjects surrounding Complexity Science. This entails computational simulations, complex system modelling amongst other things. It is a way to view the world more holistically as oposed to the usual reductionistic methods of science. We try to put all the pieces of research back to each other, and try to examine the systems higher level characteristics.
