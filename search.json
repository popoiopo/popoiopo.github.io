[{"categories":["ComputerScience"],"content":" Recap previous  In the previous post, we talked about what version control is, how it stores its versions of files and how centralized and distributed version control works. We mostly talked about the intuition of why we would want to use version control but also had a glimpse of the problems that can arise once collaboration comes into play. If you haven't read the post, here it is.\n  This post  In this post, we will talk about the three stages that a file can be in when tracked by Git. We will not discuss how to install Git, nor will we discuss where the command line is in your system and how that works. So some prior knowledge is assumed. The things discussed here are, just as the previous post, discussed in this book. So if you want more details, please refer to the book.\n  The three states   A file in a Git repository can be in three different main stages; modified, staged, and committed.\n  Modified   You changed the file but have not committed the changes to your database.\n  Staged   You marked the modified file in the current version to go into your next commit.\n  Committed   The data is stored in the database!\n  These three stages lead to the main sections of a Git project; the working tree, the staging area, and the git directory.\n  Working tree   A single checkout of one version of the project 1. The files in these versions are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.\n  Staging area   The staging area, aka \"index\", is a file in your Git directory, storing information about what will be in your next commit.\n  Git directory   The place where Git stores the metadata and database for your project. Needless to say, this is the backbone of the Git experience, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.\n    Creating a git directory  Say you have a project that you work on and want to have version controlled. This project lives in some folder that you have somewhere (I usually have my git directories stored in a directory called github in the home directory). But people also keep them in the well-known Documents folder, or whatever makes you happy 😃 Note that I use folder and directory interchangeably2.\n Let's say you have a fantastic project that lives in a directory that we'll call path/to/project which you want to version control. You first need to go to your terminal, go to that directory, and initialize it as a git repository.\n1 2 3 4  # Go to the right directory (cd stands for Change Directory) cd path/to/project # Initialize the git directory git init     This will create a new subdirectory called .git that contains all the repository files. At this point, it is just a bare skeleton that has no files tracked. To actually start version-controlling an existing file, you want to add those files that you want tracked. So let's say this is your project directory:\n1 2 3 4 5  ├─ Project │ ├─ Readme.org │ ├─ main.py │ ├─ images │ │ ├─ img1.png     We have a Readme.org, which contains information about the project, a main.py, which is just the main python file, and an images directory which contains an image (img1.png). To add the Readme.org to the Git tracking, we simply do the following:\n1 2  git add Readme.org git commit -m \"Adding readme to the project tracking\"     Git add adds the Readme.org file to the tracker and stages it to be commited (so it's in the staging area now). Another way to add files is by using wildcards. Say you want to add all python files (ending with .py), then you could do git add *.py in which the star means that it doesn't matter what comes before the .py as long it ends with it. Git commit commits the tracked file to the git directory, and the current version is saved! Now, should anything go wrong, we can always return to this version! The -m flag just means that we add a message to the commit. This usually is just a short description of the commit's changes, so you can easily see what you did.\n Here you can already see the lifecycle of the status of your files. First they are untracked and Git doesn't know about those files. Then after you track them, Git knows about them and they can be in the three stages.\n     Footnotes   1 You can have multiple working versions of the project next to each other. For example, you can have a production version and a version in which you add functionality. Then, if the new functionality is done, you could merge the two versions. These three phases lend themselves to a workflow in the same order. (1) You make changes in a file (file is modified). (2) After you're happy with your changes, you can stage those changes that you want to be part of your next committed. Only the files you added are brought to the staging area and can then be considered staged. (3) You do a commit, taking those staged files in the staging area and storing that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.\n  2 Funfact! Folders and directories are used interchangeably as they usually refer to the same thing. If we'd really want to nitpick, there is a difference. In a GUI (graphical user interface), such as Windows, a folder doesn't necessarily map to a specific hard drive location, a construct meant to mimic a real folder called a shell namespace. For example, a folder you've created to hold pictures on your desktop. While with a command-line interface (e.g., MS-DOS or Linux), you would say directory instead of folder as a directory is mapped to a physical location on a storage medium.\n    ","description":"","tags":["Git","VersionControl"],"title":"Lets talk about git (Part 2)","uri":"/post/lets_talk_about_git2/"},{"categories":["ComputerScience"],"content":" Why am I writing this?  As I am reading this book I want to create a place where I can place my notes in a way that makes sense, and that is easily used for reference later on. After several years of doing projects and using the superficial Git commands, it is time to delve a little deeper and actually understand what I'm doing. Instead of merely repeating git commands, I find on stack overflow whenever something needs to be fixed. As I do see the value of using branches, merging files, etc., they have always scared me somehow. So let's try to overcome this by reading the book and making a nice post in the meantime!\n  What is Version Control?  Controlling them versions  We've all been there in the good old days. Writing a report in word, saving it with a name like final report.docx. But after some feedback from the teacher, you need to make some changes. However, just working in your old file just makes you feel antsy; you've worked really hard on those things you wrote! So you make the suggested changes and call the new file final final report.docx. Then you ask a friend to look at your work and give some feedback which then culminates in a third final report3.docx. This is when you look at your folder and realize the hell you're creating for yourself! And that, my friends, is where version control comes in.\n    Version control is a way to keep track of your project changes (usually a folder that has all the important files relating to a project). These changes can entail anything in any file within that project, from changing images if you are a graphic designer to code file changes if you are building an application. The reason you'd want this is that it gives you the ability to revert to earlier states in your project. You know, before you made that horrible mistake that messed everything up.\n So one way that version control can handle keeping track of these ghosts of the past is by utilizing a database that keeps track of all changes. So each file is essentially linked to its former versions in said database. More specifically, it keeps track of only the differences between files (not necessarily each whole file). Recreating a file becomes just a function of adding up all changes up to the version you're interested in. This method is called delta-based version control. Delta is usually used to indicate differences, so the name makes sense.\n Another way, the way that is used by Git, is using a stream of snapshots. A snapshot can be seen as a picture you take of what your file looks like at that moment. When you say to Git that you want to save your current state, it saves a snapshot of every file with reference to that snapshot. To not take too much space, when a file is unchanged between the current and last commit, Git will just save that reference to the snapshot of the last time that the file was changed. It is like a string of beads onto which a new bead is added on the string on every text change. If text remains unchanged during a commit, there will be an empty space until the next bead is added.\n  Collaboration  Collaborating in a project with multiple people brings about its own special set of problems. First of all, the projects need to be accessible to all collaborators. This can be done by one centralized server to log in, have all versioned files in one place, and make changes. However, having a single place to which you store your files is never a good idea. What is the server, which is just some computer elsewhere that you can log in to, crashes? What if there is a power outage in the server location? You'd be unable to work for that time.\n That is why distributed version control systems such as Git exist. Things are not being kept in a single location but rather on all locations that work in the project. With this, I mean that every collaborator keeps their own mirror of the project, including its full history of all files. So when a new person wants to join the collaboration, they just have to pull the latest version from the server, and off they go! Therefore, if any of the machines blow up (to be a bit dramatic), the other computers will still have their version of the entire project.\n    Figure of a distributed version control system (the figure is adopted from the book$^1$).    Suppose one person makes changes to their own version of the project. In that case, they can push that version to the server, making it accessible to all collaborators. Those other people can then pull the most recent version of the project as a whole. Everyone has the entire history of the project right there on the local disk, so everyone can work with their version while still keeping track of who made what changes in which file.\n This way of working locally allows for browsing your project's history without the internet, as it can all be used locally. So if you are without internet and still want to work, you can! You can even look back at older versions of a file, make changes to a new file, commit those changes, and when you have internet again, push those changes to the server and therefore backing it up nicely.\n This all works a bit more intricate than I described here, but we got the basic intuition. More problems need to be addressed, and we'll get to those in another post. But the foundation of understanding version control has been laid here.\n    References    Chacon, S., \u0026 Straub, B., Pro git (2014): Springer Nature.\n    ","description":"","tags":["Git","VersionControl"],"title":"Lets talk about git","uri":"/post/lets_talk_about_git/"},{"categories":["Writing"],"content":" Once upon a time, there was a land filled with retirees in a kingdom far, far away. These elderly people might have been old, but were still very much young at heart. However, the land was much too big, and all lived at a great distance from one another, making contact difficult. These were trying times, as a new disease called \"loneliness\" ravaged the lands.\n One day, the king decided to summon his counsel and ordered them to develop new and innovative ways to combat this \"loneliness.\" But all the kings' horses, and all the kings' men, could not make the land great again. The \"loneliness\" kept on with it's devouring appetite, and people even spoke of a situation of pandemic proportions. And so it was, for months, the kingdom was as if it was shut down. It's citizens experiencing loneliness so profound; they did not want to come out of bed anymore.\n At one Thursday morning, somewhere in July, a peculiar little creature popped up. It had pointy ears, big eyes, and wearing nothing but a raggedy cushion cover and one single sock. Looking dazed, it slowly stumbled towards a big fallen oak tree. As it sat there, for three hours long, it pondered where it was, and how it got there. Especially the \"where\" of it all was quite the conundrum. It had already become midday by this time, and the creature set out to find someone to talk to.\n Two days went by, and the little creature did not find anyone until it stumbled onto what seemed to be an abandoned house. At least, so it seemed. The creature knocked on the door, and no one answered. It walked around to the garden, and no one was there. It even climbed up on the roof to look through the windows, but they were so dirty that it could not even see through them. The little creature was just about to give up when he saw a tiny window open on the side of the house. Being of a very small stature himself, he had no difficulty in climbing through. Though it was nervous, it had to find at least a place to sleep. First, there was a large and dusty living room. Then, a cold hallway tiled with marble stones leading to a wooden carved stairway. Up the stairs, the creature went, when a glimpse of movement caught his eye.\n A PERSON!\n Quickly and overeagerly, he ran towards the room. There was a queen-sized bed with an older gentleman in it. The gentleman was startled and hid under the covers, hoping that the creature would go away. But the creature did not go away; it even spoke to him. It noticed how frightened the man was and immediately calmed down. \"Hello, I'm awfully sorry to barge in like this,\" the creature said. \"May I ask you what your name is? Mine is Dobby.\". The gentleman was so captured by Dobby's politeness and warm voice that he could not help but feeling calmed down. \"Robert… My name is Robert.\", he said. Robert, who had not seen anyone in what seems to be forever, was filled with glee and confusion. Another person!\n As Dobby and Robert were glad to have finally found someone, they began to talk. After conversing for hours on end until it became dark outside, Dobby queried an especially important question. \"Where is everyone?\" asked Dobby. Robert reacted with silence. A silence broken by a tear that rolled down from his cheek, after which he replied: \"The loneliness… The loneliness has gotten a hold of all of us. Even the king attempted to make things right, but no one succeeded…\". Dobby sat there and thought about what exactly loneliness was. Loneliness is a distressing experience when a person's social relationships are perceived to be less in quantity, especially in quality, than desired. While Dobby sat there, thinking, Robert went to bed as it was already far beyond midnight. Dobby, however, stayed and pondered. Social relationships that are perceived less in quantity and especially in quality… What can help? What can bring people together? What can bridge these vast distances and combat this \"loneliness\"? Dobby sat quietly, thinking until he fell asleep.\n A rumbling sound. There was a rumbling sound coming from downstairs, and a fantastic smell welcomed Dobby back to reality. He went downstairs only to find Robert up and about, happily making breakfast for the both of them. Robert greeted Dobby with a grand smile, and then a moment! A special eureka moment! Dobby had found what he spent all night looking for and was overjoyed. \"Personal contact!\" screamed Dobby. \"Personal, meaningful contact with other people!\". Robert looked confused and asked what Dobby was trying to tell him. Back where Dobby was from, there was this magical thing called the internet. And the internet could connect people with strange contraptions called \"phones\". A rather silly name, but they held great powers of communication. In these \"phones,\" people could play games, talk to one another, and send snapshots of pretty much anything! \"With these phones, we could connect these people living in isolation! They could talk to each other all the time, just like we did last night,\" said Dobby. Robert was so excited about this story that he forgot that he was cooking and accidentally burned his specialty dish, eggs benedict. He told about a treasure chest that the king had for innovative projects, which he called the National Wellbeing Operation (NWO). The NWO was explicitly set up to fund new projects that showed great promise to increase the kingdoms' wellbeing. Dobby felt they were onto something significant, and Robert suggested going to the king as soon as possible. They got ready, ate the burned eggs benedict that has never tasted better, and left.\n A long and arduous journey ensued. A journey containing enough material to cover several books had come to an end. The two travelers had reached the castle of the king.\n An open gate, an empty hall, a dusty dining room were all that reminded Dobby about his first encounter with Robert. On arriving at the kingly bedroom, there was a man. Big in stature, but small in demeanor. A man who has long forgotten his ruling position as he roamed the castle day in, day out until he had become bedridden. Upon seeing the two travelers, a sea of emotions swept over him. Surprised, frightened, and happy were only some of his feelings when Dobby first spoke to him. To calm the king, Robert took everyone to the royal kitchen and made his improved signature dish, burned eggs benedict.\n After being calmed down, Dobby went on to explain his ideas. The internet, the phones, and the NWO funding that would be needed to create an application that could connect all the kingdom's senior citizens. Having heard everything, the king sat quietly. Was this the answer to his problems? Could this project be the remedy to loneliness? He stood up and walked out onto the courtyard. With each step, it seemed that his back straightened up more and more until his small demeanor changed into an impressive display of authority. He laughed loudly and yelled: \"Of course you can have funding, I am completely at your service!\". The king foresaw one issue, though. The internet of which Dobby spoke was no easy thing to obtain. It was guarded in the black forest by a mighty fairy queen named Fay. If the plan were to succeed, they would need to convince Fay to share her precious internet with the world.\n Filled with renewed energy, the three companions left to the black forest. After a journey with many perils and adventures that would be told for generations to come, they finally arrived. There was a beautiful treehouse that grew in a way that the three travelers had never seen before. Long spirals of black wood reached as far as the eyes can see, and a single staircase that went up far beyond the forest canopy from back home. They went up and walked on the tune of what seemed like a thousand birds singing in perfect unison. Arriving at the top, there was a pond with frogs the size of horses and someone sitting at the end, wearing the most beautiful crown made out of golden leaves and silver flowers. It was queen Fay, already waiting for their arrival as the woods themselves had already informed her there were strangers in her forest. She stood up, spread her wings, and as if instantaneous, she flew towards the traveling fellowship. Hovering quietly in the air, she inquired about their purpose. She demanded them to explain quickly and concisely as she was not known for her patience. The king stepped forward and kneeled before queen Faye. \"My kingdom has befallen great tragedy, my queen. An illness named 'loneliness' has ravaged over my lands. It is our belief that the internet you hold power over could be the answer to our suffering. Our brave friend and scholar called Dobby has proved himself able to research and possibly rid my kingdom of loneliness with something called an app, which requires access to your internet\".\n The queen's face was stern, as she did not understand this concept of loneliness. She looked at Dobby and asked him to explain. \"It is our belief that loneliness is an unpleasant emotional response to perceived isolation. A type of social pain that can lie at the root of many issues, both psychological and physical. Our quest entails removing this ailment from the people by creating a communication platform that is a playful virtual environment to share one's experiences and make new ones. This application will monitor and optimize social interaction as it develops and deepens its users' relationships.\" The queen found difficulty in this concept, as she was never alone. She interacted with the birds, the frogs, and even the forest itself. As such, she had never known such a painful silence in her life. However, she could understand when thinking about losing her forest. This was a chilling thought which caused her to agree and provide access to the internet.\n The fellowship was happy that they could finally start their research, but all knew that they still had a long way to go. A total of four years passed in which several ups and downs were posed. An arduous road that eventually led to the application Dobby has dreamed about. As they released it, it spread like wildfire. Every single person in the kingdom started playing, talking, laughing with one another. The loneliness had finally subsided. Dobby was awarded the medal of doctorship and a fresh set of clean clothes. However, there was one piece of clothing that Dobby did not want to part from. The one single sock that held special meaning to him.\n And they lived happily ever after.\n","description":"","tags":["Storytelling"],"title":"The creature, the gentleman, and the king","uri":"/post/dobby-fairytale/"},{"categories":["Writing"],"content":" Once upon a time, there was a french frog named Frederique.

Hij kwam wat dichter bij en wachtte even. Er gebeurde helemaal niks. Nog iets dichter bij dan maar. Hmm, nog steeds niks, en de olifant zat daar maar.
